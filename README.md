# Paddy Disease Prediction

This project is focused on detecting diseases in paddy (rice) leaves using machine learning techniques. The notebook was originally developed in Kaggle and has been migrated here for sharing and collaboration.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Paddy crop diseases can significantly reduce yield and quality. This project leverages image-based classification to identify common diseases in rice leaves using deep learning.

## 📁 Files

- `paddydiseaseprediction.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing all the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab / Kaggle Notebook environment

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes images of paddy leaves categorized into multiple disease classes:
- Healthy
- Brown Spot
- Hispa
- Leaf Blast

> Dataset was used from Kaggle and preloaded in the notebook.

## 🧪 Model

A convolutional neural network (possibly MobileNetV2 or similar) is used for feature extraction and classification.

## 🚀 How to Run

To run this project:

1. Download the notebook:


2. Open it in:
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- Local Jupyter Notebook

3. Ensure the dataset is available in the appropriate path or uploaded.

4. Run each cell in sequence to train and test the model.

## ✅ Results

- The notebook includes training/validation accuracy and loss plots.
- Model evaluation on test data.
- Sample predictions and confusion matrix.

## 📌 Future Work

- Deploy the model as a web app.
- Improve model accuracy with data augmentation and transfer learning.
- Add real-time image prediction.
